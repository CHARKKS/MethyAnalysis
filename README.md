# MethyAnalysis
## Purpose: Identify and annotate differnetially methylated regions between cellin es that have wild type EZh2 and the cell ines that have hyperactive EZH2

## Hypothesis: There is a correlation between EZH2 hypermutants and aberrant DNA methylation in GCB DLBCL cell lines (this is not the best written hypothesis. try to bring out the idea that EZH2 hypermutations -> more than normal H3K27me3 marks -> influence activities of DNA replciation and repair (AICDA), DNA methylation

## Cell Lines that we have now:
#Normal EZH2 : CRO.AP2 FARAGE HY OCI.LY.19 SU.DHL.5 SU.DHL.8
#Hyperactive EZH2 : DB(Y641N) KARPAS.422(Y641N) RL(Y641N) SU.DHL.6(Y641N) SU.DHL.4(Y641S) WSU.DLCL2(Y641F)
